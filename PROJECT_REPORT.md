# Project Report – Pathfinding Visualizer

## 1. Introduction
The Pathfinding Visualizer is a web-based application designed to demonstrate how popular pathfinding algorithms work on a grid-based environment. The project visually represents algorithm behavior, helping learners understand traversal patterns, decision-making, and shortest-path computation.

## 2. Objectives
- To visualize pathfinding algorithms in real time
- To provide an interactive learning tool for graph algorithms
- To implement a clean modular JavaScript architecture using ES modules
- To improve understanding of algorithm efficiency and behavior

## 3. Scope of the Project
The application allows users to:
- Place start and end nodes
- Create obstacles (walls)
- Select and visualize different algorithms
- Observe step-by-step traversal and final path discovery

The project focuses on algorithm visualization and does not include backend services or persistent storage.

## 4. Technologies Used
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and layout
- JavaScript (ES Modules) for logic and modular design

## 5. Algorithms Implemented
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- A* (A-Star) Algorithm

## 6. System Architecture
The project follows a modular architecture where state management, grid handling, animations, and algorithms are separated into individual modules for maintainability and scalability.

## 7. Results
The system successfully visualizes each algorithm’s behavior with clear animations. Users can compare different algorithms and observe differences in speed and traversal patterns.

## 8. Conclusion
The Pathfinding Visualizer effectively demonstrates core pathfinding concepts and serves as a strong educational and portfolio project showcasing frontend and algorithmic skills.

## 9. Future Enhancements
- Maze generation algorithms
- Speed control slider
- Diagonal movement support
- Weighted nodes
- GitHub Pages deployment
