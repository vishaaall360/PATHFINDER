# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction
This document specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for the Pathfinding Visualizer application.

## 2. Overall Description

- The system shall visualize the selected algorithm
- The system shall display the final path if one exists

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- The application shall be responsive
- The visualization shall be smooth and animated
- The system shall run in modern browsers
- The codebase shall follow modular design principles

## 5. User Interface Requirements
- Clear grid layout
- Visible color distinction for nodes
- Intuitive control buttons and dropdowns

## 6. Constraints
